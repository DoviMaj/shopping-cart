          Ferrari is an Italian automotive manufacturer in the Formula One World
          Championship, also involved in high-end and high-performance racing
          cars, supercars, and luxury sports cars. The company was founded by
          Enzo Ferrari in 1939 out of Alfa Romeo's race division as Auto Avio
          Costruzioni, the company built its first car in 1940. However, the
          company's inception as an auto manufacturer is usually recognized in
          1947, when the first Ferrari-badged car was completed.

          In 2014 Ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand by Brand
          Finance. In June 2018, the 1964 250 GTO became the most expensive car
          in history, setting an all-time record selling price of $70 million.

          Our story officially begins in 1947 when the first car built under the
          Ferrari marque, the 125 S, drove through the historic factory gates on
          Via Abetone Inferiore in Maranello. That said, Ferrari’s origins are
          inextricably linked to its founder’s entire life story.

          Born in Modena on February 18 1898, Enzo Ferrari passed away on August
          14 1988, having devoted his entire life to motor racing. He became an
          Alfa Romeo works driver in 1924 but just five years later set up the
          Scuderia Ferrari at Viale Trieste in Modena to allow its mostly
          gentleman driver members compete.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1938, Ferrari was appointed head of Alfa Corse. However, he left in
          1939 to start up Auto Avio Costruzioni in the Scuderia’s old
          headquarters.
        </p>
        <p>
          His new company founded, Enzo Ferrari built a sports car, a spider
          powered by a 1500 cc 8-cylinder engine. He called it the 815 and two
          were built. The car also took part in the 1940 Mille Miglia.
          Unfortunately, the outbreak of World War Two brought all motor racing
          to an abrupt end. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In late 1943, Ferrari moved Auto Avio Costruzioni’s workshops from
          Modena to Maranello. At the end of the War, he set about designing and
          building what was to become the first Ferrari, the 125 S, a 1500cc
          12-cylinder. Franco Cortese drove the car in its maiden race at the
          Piacenza Circuit on May 11 1947 and again to its first victory in the
          Rome Grand Prix at the Terme di Caracalla circuit on the 25
          <sup>th</sup> of the same month.
